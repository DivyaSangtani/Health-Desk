# Health-Desk

Hello everyone, This was a minor project that I designed in the third year of my college. It is a website which is created to bridge the gap between the doctors, the patients and the facilities available for the them. This is a website which will allow the patient as well as the doctor to enroll and to find each other. The main purpose is to develop software which is user friendly simple, fast, and cost effective.
