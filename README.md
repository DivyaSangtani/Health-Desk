# Health-Desk

The purpose of the project entitled as “HEALTH DESK” is to bridge the gap between the doctors, the patients and the facilities available for the them. This is a website which will allow the patient as well as the doctor to enroll and to find each other. The main purpose is to develop software which is user friendly simple, fast, and cost effective. It deals with the collection of patient’s information, doctor’s information, available blood banks, donation facilities etc. The data here will be well protected for personal use and makes the data processing very fast.
HEALTH DESK is an attempt to move from sectoral and segmented approach of health service delivery to a comprehensive need-based health care service. This scheme aims to undertake path breaking interventions to holistically address the healthcare system (covering prevention, promotion and ambulatory care) at the primary, secondary and tertiary level. Health and Wellness Centers are envisaged to deliver an expanded range of services to address the primary health care needs of the entire population in their area, expanding access, universality and equity close to the community. The emphasis of health promotion and prevention is designed to bring focus on keeping people healthy by engaging and empowering individuals and communities to choose healthy behaviours and make changes that reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases and morbidities.The cover under the scheme includes all expenses incurred on the following components of the treatment.
